Brain Tissue Magnetic Resonance Imaging Segmentation Using Anisotropic Textural Features
The proposed framework created a novel feature space with curvelet transform to improve the segmentation performance under different scans for three brain tissues, gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In the first step, the feature set was extracted from the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) on the curvelet transformed image. Afterward, feature selection was utilized to reduce computational complexity and select more relevant features. Then, the selected features were categorized into three tissues. The segmentation results were compared with the ground truth label to evaluate performance metrics. Finally, the results were interpreted and analyzed with anatomical information in different brain scans.
